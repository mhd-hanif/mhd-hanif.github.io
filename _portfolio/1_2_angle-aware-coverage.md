## Short Summary

This work presents a novel angle-aware coverage control method that integrates **Voronoi-based coverage** as the nominal input into the quadratic programming problem required to solve the original **angle-aware coverage control**, aimed at improving monitoring efficiency in large-scale 3D map reconstruction using drone networks. The approach ensures diverse viewing angles, enhancing 3D map quality. Both simulations in ROS and real-world experiments in a **testbed** validate the methodâ€™s effectiveness, especially in large-scale missions where traditional techniques underperform.

## Application
- **Agriculture**: Precision crop mapping.
- **Disaster Management**: Rapid mapping of disaster zones.
- **Urban Mapping**: Detailed mapping of city infrastructure.

## Key Method
The system uses **Voronoi Coverage** for area partitioning, dynamically adjusting drone flight paths to ensure optimal coverage with minimal overlaps, while employing the angle-aware method to capture images from various viewing angles.

## Conclusion
The approach improves both **monitoring efficiency** and **map quality**, significantly reducing drone travel time to unobserved areas in large-scale applications.

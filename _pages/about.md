**Welcome 😀**  
======  
I am currently a PhD candidate in Systems and Control Engineering at [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/), advised by [Prof. Takeshi Hatanaka](https://hatanakalab.wixsite.com/website/faculty). My research focuses on coverage control and multi-robot systems, primarily using UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) 🚁.

Before starting my PhD, I completed my Master's degree at Tokyo Institute of Technology, where I worked on multi-robot task allocation problems using UAVs and UGVs (Unmanned Ground Vehicles) to address solar radiation monitoring in a thermosolar plant. This research was conducted in collaboration with the [University of Seville](https://www.us.es/), under the supervision of [Prof. J.M. Maestre](https://personal.us.es/jmaestre/).

Earlier, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the [Bandung Institute of Technology](https://www.itb.ac.id/), Indonesia, where I worked on a Hybrid Autonomous Underwater Glider (HAUG) with [Prof. Bambang Riyanto](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=Ik5Ft5EAAAAJ&hl).
